# 91896_7-RATS

No fancy wizard magic used to directly update changes I make from vscode to github because I am a neanderthal incapable of comprehending it 
Instead I'll make a new file at the end of each session with the updated code and commit it to this repository.
The files will be named by their component or "Main", and given a date.
